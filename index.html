             Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on experience designing, building, and deploying production-grade ML, Deep Learning, and Generative AI systems for enterprise financial and healthcare clients, including TD Bank, RBC, and Quest Diagnostics. I specialize in LLM engineering, RAG pipelines, and agentic AI workflows, alongside traditional ML (Computer Vision, NLP, Recommendation Systems), and have shipped models serving 1,000+ concurrent users with sub-100ms latency and 99.2% uptime in Kubernetes-based environments.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">
            My core stack includes Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP (Vertex AI, SageMaker), with strong MLOps foundations in CI/CD for ML, MLflow, model monitoring, drift detection, and automated retraining. I enjoy translating complex ML concepts into clear business value, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and owning the end-to-end lifecycle from data and modeling through deployment, observability, and continuous improvement.

                <li>Built a robust ingestion pipeline with OCR, semantic chunking, and structural parsing to normalize long, complex documents, enabling accurate downstream clause detection and metadata extraction across jurisdictions and languages.</li>
                <li>Fine‑tuned transformer‑based LLMs and domain‑specific legal models for clause classification, obligation extraction, and anomaly detection, iterating for weeks to reach ~99% accuracy under strict law‑firm quality requirements.</li>
